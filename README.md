wwwhtmlcom

custom quick queries

quickly search the net, ebay, track usp/fedex/usps, and more with super quick html pages with just a search/textbox and button

a shortcut past jumping through hoops indicating country/language or waiting for slow/bloated full site to load first just to navigate to their tracker page

FUTURE: create either an overarching jump page to the available searcher tools and/or an omnipage containing all the actual individual searchers (their textbox/button or else just one textbox and multiple buttons (?)


NOTE: ALL FUTURECOMMITS NOW REQUIRE MANDATORY GPG SIGNATURES
